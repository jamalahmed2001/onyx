# audio-master

> Master audio to streaming-spec LUFS and concatenate segments cleanly. One skill, many callers — tune via `--target-lufs` and `--codec`.

## When a directive should call this

- Finishing raw TTS segments into a publish-ready podcast/narration MP3
- Mastering Suno-generated tracks to a consistent album LUFS before export
- Concatenating multiple polished segments with clean silence gaps (no malformed MP3)

## When NOT to call this

- Stem mixing / multi-track production → use a DAW
- Format conversion only (no loudness work) → call `ffmpeg` directly
- Anything that needs subjective EQ/compression decisions — this is a loudness + concat tool only

## How to call it

```bash
# Master a single file
~/clawd/skills/audio-master/bin/audio-master master \
  --input ./raw/seg-01.mp3 \
  --output ./out/seg-01.mp3 \
  --target-lufs -14 \
  --codec mp3

# Concatenate mastered segments with 500ms silence between
~/clawd/skills/audio-master/bin/audio-master concat \
  --inputs "./seg-01.mp3,./seg-02.mp3,./seg-03.mp3" \
  --output ./full.mp3 \
  --gap-ms 500
```

Emits structured JSON on stdout (success) or stderr (error with classification).

## Credentials

None — reads/writes local files. Requires `ffmpeg` on PATH.

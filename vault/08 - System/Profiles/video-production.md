# Profile: video-production

> For phases that produce video — animated shorts, serial cartoons, scripted live-action with synthesised audio, music videos, mixed-media. This profile sits between `content` and `audio-production`: video pipelines are content pipelines that also produce audio that also produce visuals. It pulls disciplines from both.

---

## When to use this profile

- A phase calls a video-gen model (Veo, Kling, Sora, Runway, etc.).
- A phase composes multi-reference keyframes (`nano-banana-compose`).
- A phase renders Remotion / After Effects / Blender output.
- A phase burns subtitles (`subtitle-burner`).
- A phase mixes voice + music + SFX into a video soundtrack.

Use *with* `audio-production` for video pipelines (the audio side runs on audio-production rules; the visual side runs on this profile's rules). Use this profile alone if the project is silent / music-only video.

## Required Overview fields

```yaml
profile: video-production
aspect_ratio: 16:9                       # 16:9 | 9:16 | 1:1 | 4:5 — drives every shot, render, and export
target_duration_s: 60                    # sum of all shot durations; audio drives this
render_engine: remotion                  # remotion | ffmpeg-only | external
voice_profile: "Voices/<voice-name>.md"  # narrator voice (if any)
lufs_target: -14                         # final mix loudness; -14 LUFS for streaming, -23 for broadcast
```

---

## Phase fields

Per-phase frontmatter:

```yaml
shot_list_path: Shots/                   # where the scene-composer's shot files live
keyframe_dir: output/keyframes/E03/      # where per-shot keyframes get written
render_output: output/video/E03.mp4      # final video target
```

---

## Acceptance gate

Before a video-production phase transitions to `completed`:

1. **Audio-first invariant.** The shot list's total duration matches the audio segment's actual duration ±100ms. (See [[08 - System/Principles/audio-first-pipeline.md|audio-first-pipeline]].)
2. **Aspect ratio honoured.** Every keyframe and the final render are exactly the declared `aspect_ratio`.
3. **Continuity stack.** Each character close-up shot uses the verbatim Bible description and the negative-prompt stack from the character's Bible entry.
4. **No leaked tokens.** No on-screen text from the model; any text overlays are post-render via ffmpeg.
5. **Final render exists** at `render_output` and is ≥ 90% of `target_duration_s` (allowing for fade-outs).

## Bundle structure

When `onyx init` creates a video-production project, it generates:

## Skills the profile expects on PATH

- `nano-banana-compose` — multi-ref keyframe composition
- `fal` — video-gen models (Veo / Kling / Sora / Runway)
- `elevenlabs-tts` — narrator / character voices
- `audio-master` — per-segment loudness conformance
- `suno-generate` — music beds
- `subtitle-burner` — burned-in captions for short-form export
- `whisper-groq` — transcription for caption alignment
